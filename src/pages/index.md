  title: A little about me
  description: I began my journey into web development while initially pursuing a
    degree in biology. The class that started me down this path was aimed at
    hand coding very basic html and javascript pages and providing some
    experience using Drupal since that was what the University I was attending
    at the time was using for their sites.
description: This blog was set up as part of the DGM-3780 course and will serve
  as a platform to post updates about the course and projects.
