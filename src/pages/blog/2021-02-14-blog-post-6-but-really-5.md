So this week we looked into using TypeScript, and personally I havent delved into it enough to see any bennifits other than built in type checking whcih so far seems like an edgecase solution. That being said i'm sure there will be instances where TypeScript may prove usefull.



These are the following points we're going to go over.

* **What is TypeScript?**

  * TypeScript is a supper set (I believe) of javascript which basicly focuses on and enforces data type decleration, use, and compliance. This generally means the javascript works just fine in typescript but additionally you can also use typescripts langauge specific features in it as well.
* **How does TypeScript help developers? Why is it a tool worth considering?**

  * In theory it helps developers by enforcing data types on projects and codes, that being said in my oppinion as of now its more hassle than its worth. that being said, when I have more time to look into i'd be interested in learning more and seeing if theres more to it.
* **What is the difference between compilation vs transpilation?**

  * So compilation generally takes source code and processes it down to a base code be it something like C or even further to machine code.
  * Transpilation however is taking one source level code and rewriting it to another source level code that is then broken down further by a compiler.
